				<h1>The vision for a new genre of games</h1>

				Terminal games used to be everywhere. Remember the ones where you'd be
				given a situation and a bunch of options to choose from to "choose your
				own adventure"? Those games are a far cry from the incredibly realistic
				(and computationally demanding) video games we are used to today.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a game like that was just released in 2024, you'd probably not think
				much of it and be completely uninterested. Honestly, I would feel the
				same. But I feel like this kind of game has a lot of potential. If retro
				games like Tetris can make a comeback, why can't terminal games?
			</p>
			<p>
				Picture an MMORPG, like, for example, Warframe. Now imagine what it
				would be like if that was combined with the classic text-based games
				from the 80s. That's the vision I have, one I want to realise through
				Boxkat.
			</p>
			<p>
				I haven't yet worked out the specifics of how such a game would work,
				nor do I have so much as a basic story line or even a name planned out,
				but what appeals to me about a game like this would be not only its
				uniqueness, but its portability: you could run this game on anything
				with a processor and an internet connection.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will definitely be working on a demo of this idea, and when it's in a
				playable state, I'll add a download link here. I'm super excited to see
				how this idea turns out, and I hope other people will be as intrigued as
				I am!
